# ArtificialPersona
A neural network based data pipeline that combines the power of speech to text, text to speech, and deepfake technologies to enable real-time, anonymous voice and visual communication online.

Anonymity online is not a new topic. Various studies, such as the work of Nissenbaum in "Privacy
in Context" and Davenport et al. in "Identity and deception in the virtual community," have discussed the
importance of anonymity for preserving privacy and promoting open and unbiased communication.
Similar projects include Anonymous Internet Browsing tools like Tor, virtual private networks (VPNs), and
anonymous communication apps such as Signal and Whisper. However, most of these tools focus on
textual communication and anonymization of IP addresses, and do not extend to visual and voice-based
interactions.
